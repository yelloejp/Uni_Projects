**Version 1.0.0**

Project descriptions of backgrounds and goals. 

## 1. Temperature prediction

A company installed sensors in a city to collect temperature data but the sensors show gaps in the same region depending on the environment such as latitude, distance from rivers, etc.. The goal is to build a model to predict temperature of the sensors by using temperature data by sensors and National Weather Service. 

## 2. Text classifcation

One of big issues in natual language problems is to handle large scale datasets. Several approaches have been introduced to solve text classification problem but have not tried large scale datasets. The goal is to build graph-based text classification model by stochastic sampling subgraph to train the model.
