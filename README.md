**Version 2.0.0**

Project descriptions of backgrounds and goals. 

## 1. Temperature prediction

A company installed sensors in a city to collect temperature data but the sensors show gaps in the same region depending on the environment such as latitude, distance from rivers, etc.. The goal is to build a model to predict temperature of the sensors by using temperature data by sensors and National Weather Service. 

## 2. Text classifcation

One of big issues in natual language problems is to handle large scale datasets. Several approaches have been introduced to solve text classification problem but have not tried large scale datasets. The goal is to build graph-based text classification model which can cope with large scale datasets. 

## 3. Image classifcation

Computer vision consists of different problem such as image classification, segmentation and object detection. Among those, image classification can be considered as the fundamental problem. The goal is to apply different ConvNet with different image sets. 

## 4. Word embeddings

Although many word embedding methods have been introduced, there is no grounded standard method to evaluate abilities of word embeddings. By evaluating popular word embedding methods, I'd like to focus on the abilities of word embedings.
