Project descriptions of backgrounds and goals. 

## 1. Temperature prediction

A company installed sensors in a city to collect temperature data but the sensors show gaps in the same region depending on the environment such as latitude, distance from rivers, etc.. The goal is to build a model to predict temperature of the sensors by using temperature data by sensors and National Weather Service. 

## 2. Prediction the spread of COVID-19

The objective is to build an epidemiological model that predicts the spread of COVID-19. The target variable is the cumulative number of deaths caused by COVID-19 in each country by each date. For the dataset, it has used the publicly-available data from Coronavirus COVID-19 Global Cases by the center for System Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University, which is updated on a daily-basis.
