1. Temperature prediction 
1) Background
A company installed sensors in a city to collect temperature data but the sensors show gaps in the same region depending on the environment such as latitude, distance from rivers, etc.. The goal is to build a model to predict temperature of the sensors by using temperature data by sensors and National Weather Service simultaneous.
