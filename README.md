Project descriptions of backgrounds and goals. 

## 1. Temperature prediction

A company installed sensors in a city to collect temperature data but the sensors show gaps in the same region depending on the environment such as latitude, distance from rivers, etc.. The goal is to build a model to predict temperature of the sensors by using temperature data by sensors and National Weather Service. 

## 2. Prediction of precipitation

NASA has been conducting many studies to calculate precipitation using satellites since the 1970s and has provided global precipitation every 30 mins. NASA utilizes a Bayesian statistical technique which limits scalable database for global domain. The goal is to build a model which is faster and achieves higher accuracy than NASA's model.
