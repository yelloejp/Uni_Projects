# Description

Key: Word2Vec, GloVe, pre-trained embeddings, nltk

## Experiment 1) Word similarity 
- A big limit that datasets for word similarity evaluations is lack of numbers of word pairs. Another challange is that word pairs are prejudged by human. 
- To get bigger numbers of pairs, we create our own word pairs and evluate word embeddings with pairs. 

## Experiment 2) Text Classification 
- To compare different word embeddings, we test that with text classification problem.
